Hi! I am Munawira Kotyad.

I am currently pursuing my Phd in Computer Science from [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). My research interests lie in GPGPU Architecture and Performance, Microarchitecture Performance and OS-Microarch Interactioins. I am primarily conducting research in the area GPU microarchitecture enhancements to accelerate non traditional, scientific and AI  GPGPU workloads. The research involves designing novel out of order scheduling techniques and front end pipeline redesign to extract Instruction Level Parallelism from applications with limited data level parallelism.


## Education:

I have a Master's  of Science Degree from North Carolina State University, Raleigh. Most of my courses and projects were focused on Microarchitecture, Operating Systems and Parallel computing. 

## Experience:

Following my Masterâ€™s degree, I joined Intel Corporation at Oregon as a Software engineer in their Windows Operating Systems team that works on OS optimization for Intel Architecture. My role involved development of the Intel power engine plugin and new power saving features for Windows 10. Additionally I developed multiple kernel drivers for proof of concepts and technology readiness work using KMDF.

I will be using this space to update my projects and research progress during my PhD Journey.
