Hi! I am Munawira Kotyad.

I am currently pursuing my Phd in Computer Science from [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). My research interests lie in Microarchitecture Performance and OS-Microarch Interactioins. I am primarily conducting research in the area of Address Translation bottlenecks for modern server and irregular workloads. 


## Education:

I have a Master's  of Science Degree from North Carolina State University, Raleigh. Most of my courses and projects were focused on Microarchitecture, Operating Systems and Parallel computing. 

## Experience:

After graduating, I started working as a Core OS developer at Intel Corporation in Oregon. I worked on OS optimization of Windows operating systems across Intel architecture. My work required writing kernel drivers to implement various power saving features for Windows OS. 

I will be using this space to update my projects and research progress during my PhD Journey.
